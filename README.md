# Rotten-Tomato-Review-Data

# For this program to run you have to go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyamchoksi/rotten-tomato-movie-reviews-1-44m-rows and download the source data as it is too large for a github repository to hold.

# This program takes that data and converts it so that you can use functions that show the final dataset with averaged results and dates for each movie, save that data, show a graph of the movie reviews on date search and search for any movie and see its review.
