    "In this project I am trying to find out if there has been a decline in movie media recception in recent years, I belive this is important because large cultural phenomenon such as the final episode of [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Finale_(Seinfeld)) with 76.3 million viewers which bring people together. But if there has been a large decline in popular media such as movies people would move to more individual social media platforms like youtube, instagram and tiktok making them connect with other people less.\n",

    "People who will benifit from the information I create will be the general population, who would want better movies if the reviews are declining, and movie makers, who may see that there is a hole in the market for high quality media rather than the new model of cheap fast media.\n",

    " __Use:__\\\n",
